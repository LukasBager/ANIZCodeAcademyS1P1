Assignment: You Are the Software Architect
Scenario

You are hired as the lead software architect for a company developing a new smart refrigerator system.
Your team has implemented two versions:
Version A: Inheritance without abstraction (uses instanceof)
Version B: Inheritance with abstraction and polymorphism

The company expects:
The system will grow
New product types will be added frequently
Multiple developers will work on the code
The system must be maintainable for 10+ years
Your task is to choose one version and defend your architectural decision.

Prepare a short architectural defense (written or oral) where you:

1️⃣ Choose Version A or Version B
You must clearly state your choice.
Justify your decision using technical arguments

🔥 Understanding Design
Which version is easier to extend?
What happens if we add a new class Cheese? Where do you need to modify the source code?
Is instanceof often considered good or bad OOP design? Why?

🧠 Design Thinking
In Version 1, which class has too much responsibility?
In Version 2, where is the behavior placed?
Which version respects encapsulation better?

🔍 Technical Understanding
Is downcasting good or bed way of programmering? ((Milk) product).pourGlass();
What could happen if we cast incorrectly?
Why does product.useProduct() work without knowing the type?

📈 Scalability Questions
Which version scales better for 20 product types?
Which version would require more modifications when adding new subclasses?
Which version is easier to maintain?

🎯 Conceptual OOP Questions
Where does polymorphism happen in Version1 or Version 2?
What role does abstraction play?
Which of the SmartFridge version is cleaner?
Which version would you use in a real company?
